            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>My name is Susie Neilson and I am a data reporter at the San Francisco Chronicle. I report on crime/criminal justice, housing, domestic migration patterns and, occasionally, music :) </p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>My reporting journey began at my high school paper, where I wrote balanced political stories and incredibly biased weekly horoscopes. Since then I've written for outlets including NPR, the New Yorker and New York Magazine. While I've also worked as an essayist and radio reporter, I fell in love with data reporting at UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism and have never looked back. </p>
            <h2>Fun facts</h2>
            <p>I love books, black-crowned night herons and the TV show Succession. I enjoy playing and listening to music. I have three tattoos, including one of a dinosaur. Aside from news reporting, I've also produced a documentary in South Africa, worked as a private investigator and performed in several casual bands.</p>
